    -- This is often very useful to both group configuration, as well as handle
    -- lazy loading plugins that don't need to be loaded immediately at startup.
    --
    -- For example, in the following configuration, we use:
    --  event = 'VimEnter'
    --
    -- which loads which-key before all the UI elements are loaded. Events can be
    -- normal autocommands events (`:help autocmd-events`).

    -- after the plugin has been loaded:
    --  config = function() ... end
